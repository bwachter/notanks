** Introduction

This repository contains details of my build of the [[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2789361][NoTankS tank]]. The firmware now supports multiple models at compile time, and moved [[https://github.com/aard-fi/rcfw][here]].

This repository now only contains modified 3D printed parts, for the electronic documentation check the firmware repository.

** Modified parts

*** Track segments

=track.scad= adds additional connections to stiffen up the track segments. I had my first track printed in TPU, where this was absolutely required. On hard materials it isn't as important - but from my attempts with the TPU belt I can see that those modifications reduce the stress on the track segments, so might improve track life. Drawback (or benefit?) is that you now have 4 small inserts instead of one large one.

*** Track inserts

=track_insert.scad= adds matching track inserts. Print a few and adjust tolerances - to fill all track segments completely you'll need 328 inserts. You don't want to be stuck with a mountain of hard to insert ones.

*** Covers

The cover segments were built from scratch, but fit into an existing tank frame. A M6 locking nut can be inserted via a nut catch from the side - this reduces the chance of nuts flying out during disassembly, and also makes it easier to glue it in place with a dab of hot glue. Both segments also contain two holes for 5mm LEDs.

=front_cover.scad= scad is a front cover offering a bit more space inside. Openings for ventilation and the ESC switches are configurable.

=back_cover.scad= is a back cover offering more space, mating with the above front cover.

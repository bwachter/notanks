** Introduction

This is a variant of my [[https://github.com/bwachter/arctic_tinyrider][Arctic Tinyrider controller firmware]] for the [[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2789361][NoTankS tank]]. For this variant I've moved to the [[https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-every][Arduino Nano Every]] - mainly for the additional UARTs. This is mainly useful for debugging - the RX pin is no longer shared between the iBus receiver and USB serial. Compiling it for a traditional should require only small changes.

*** Working features

- ignition switch: throttle is pinned to zero unless ignition switch is on. This allows somewhat safer handling when not fully switched off. A LED connected to D13 will signal throttle state by blinking (off) or solid light (on).
- throttle (obviously)
- turning based on accelerating or decelerating one side, depending on the current speed. This also allows turning at zero speed
- reversing
- curves for low speed cutoff to keep the motors cooler

*** Planned features

- optimising the steering to result in as little speed change as possible

*** Required hardware

- one Arduino Nano Every
- one Flysky receiver - I recommend the FS-A8S
- one Flysky radio, or any other radio capable of speaking AFHDS 2a
- two ESCs with reverse which use the first PWM input value to configure the zero position. It also should be configurable for forward/reverse - most come in forward/reverse/brake configuration, and not all allow omitting the brake.

The main drawback of the FS-A8S is the lack of a second iBus - so we can't send custom telemetry data back to the radio. On the plus side it is a tiny receiver, very cheap (roughly 10 EUR), and can output up to 18 channels via iBus. I'm not aware of receivers of a similar size with more than one iBus - other small Flysky receivers just have more connectors for PWM breakout cables, which we don't need as we're controlling that part via the Arduino.

** Modified parts

*** Track segments

=track.scad= adds additional connections to stiffen up the track segments. I had my first track printed in TPU, where this was absolutely required. On hard materials it isn't as important - but from my attempts with the TPU belt I can see that those modifications reduce the stress on the track segments, so might improve track life. Drawback (or benefit?) is that you now have 4 small inserts instead of one large one.

*** Track inserts

=track_insert.scad= adds matching track inserts. Print a few and adjust tolerances - to fill all track segments completely you'll need 328 inserts. You don't want to be stuck with a mountain of hard to insert ones.

** Transmitter setup

To use all features your transmitter should have the channels configured like this:

1. right stick, left/right
2. right stick, up/down
3. left stick, up/down (range changes based on throttle curve)
4. left stick, left/right
5. left dial VRA
6. right dial VRB
7. SWA
8. SWB
9. SWC
10. SWD

VRA/VRB are configured on channels 5/6 per default in 'aux channel setup', while the switches are not assigned.

Note that both throttle curve and trim settings will mess with the values sent by the transmitter - and probably should all be disabled.

** Wiring

You'll need one power and one ground bar to connect everything to. A quick and dirty variant is getting ready made jumper wires, cut them and then twist end solder the ends together. I recommend using the power from one ESC for the Arduino and receiver, and keeping the other one available for adding a raspberry pi.

The three-pin connector from the left ESC connects to power bar, ground bar, and pin D3 on the Arduino.

The three-pin connector from the right ESC connects to a dangling power bar, ground bar, and pin D4 on the Arduino.

Depending on your receiver you may have dedicated VCC/ground connectors, if not just connect power and ground from any channel to power/ground bars. Connect the iBus pin to the RX pin on the Arduino. Note that when flashing via USB this pin must be disconnected while flashing.

On the Arduino connect ground and VIN to ground/power bars via a diode. Without a diode the ESC might try to pull power for the motor via the Arduino if not everything is powered up, and the Arduino really doesn't like that.
